# deep_text_recognition
This is repo for detecting text in images.
--> For text spotting, you can run BoundingBox.ipynb. 
    Cropped images of the text only images will be stored in test_images/ directory.
    You can train this model using COCO-text dataset.
--> From the text only images, you can extract the text using image_text_recognition.ipynb predict function. (you may have to run previous cells before running the prediction funtion)
    You can train this model using the MJsynth dataset.
